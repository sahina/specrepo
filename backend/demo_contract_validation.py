Contract Validation Demo Script

This script demonstrates the end-to-end contract validation workflow
implemented for Task 32, including:

1. Producer validates their service against the specification using Schemathesis
2. System verifies alignment with mocks deployed from the same specification
3. Determine overall contract health based on validation results

Usage:
    python demo_contract_validation.py

Or via Makefile:
    make run-contract-validation-demo
