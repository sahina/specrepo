# HAR Review Request Workflow

## Overview

The **HAR Review Request Workflow** (`har-review-request.json`) sends review request notifications to reviewers when AI-generated HAR artifacts need approval. This workflow provides dual notifications and comprehensive review guidelines for quality assurance of AI-generated content.

## Workflow Purpose

This workflow provides specialized review request notifications that:

- Send review requests to designated reviewers for AI-generated artifacts
- Provide confirmation notifications to users who uploaded HAR files
- Include comprehensive review checklists and guidelines
- Offer direct links to review interface and artifact downloads
- Display processing context and AI configuration details
- Include review SLA and timeline information

## Webhook Configuration

- **Webhook Path**: `/har-review-request`
- **Full URL**: `http://localhost:5679/webhook/har-review-request` (development)
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json

## Workflow Structure

### Node Overview

1. **Webhook Trigger** - Receives review request notifications
2. **Data Validator** - Validates payload structure and required fields
3. **Reviewer Email Formatter** - Creates detailed review request email
4. **User Confirmation Formatter** - Creates user confirmation email
5. **Dual Email Sender** - Sends both reviewer and user notifications
6. **Response Handler** - Returns success/error responses

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Routing

The workflow can be enhanced with conditional routing based on:

- Processing options used (AI level, generalization settings)
- User permissions and roles
- Content sensitivity levels

### Integration with Review System

The workflow can integrate with external review systems:

- Create tickets in project management tools
- Update review status in external databases
- Trigger additional workflows based on review outcomes
- Generate review metrics and reports

### Automated Quality Checks

Before sending for human review, the workflow can include:

- Automated quality validation
- Security scanning of generated artifacts
- Compliance checking
- Basic accuracy verification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dual emails not sending:**
   - Check both email nodes are configured correctly
   - Verify SMTP credentials for both nodes
   - Test each email node individually

2. **Review links not working:**
   - Verify review URL format in payload
   - Check frontend review interface is accessible
   - Confirm upload_id is valid and exists

3. **Missing reviewer notifications:**
   - Check reviewer email addresses are correct
   - Verify email delivery to reviewer inboxes
   - Check spam/junk folders

### Debugging

1. **Check execution flow:**
   - Verify both email branches execute
   - Check data transformation for each email type
   - Validate payload structure and required fields

2. **Test email delivery:**
   - Use n8n's email testing features
   - Send test emails to verify SMTP configuration
   - Check email logs for delivery confirmation

3. **Validate review process:**
   - Test complete review workflow end-to-end
   - Verify review interface functionality
   - Check artifact accessibility from review links

## Integration with Backend

### Review Request Triggers

The backend should trigger this workflow when:

- AI processing completes and generates artifacts
- Quality thresholds require human review
- User explicitly requests review
- Automated quality checks flag potential issues

### Payload Requirements

Ensure the backend sends all required fields:

- `upload_id` - Unique identifier for the HAR upload
- `file_name` - Original HAR file name
- `user_id` and `user_email` - User information
- `artifacts_summary` - Summary of generated artifacts
- `review_url` - Direct link to review interface
- `processing_statistics` - Context for review

### Review Outcome Handling

The backend should handle review outcomes:

- Process approval/rejection decisions
- Update artifact status based on review results
- Notify users of review completion
- Archive or publish approved artifacts
- Handle revision requests from reviewers
